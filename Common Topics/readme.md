# Mathematics

No matter what your experience with mathematics is, you'll need to get a hang to it at university. Even if you are very far from the sciences you'll probably need some logic and some statistics. Some maths is hard (mostly because we do it not often enough) and some is realy hard (no matter how you approach it), but you are going for academical education and not dish washing so accept its hardships and take it on from the first day (actually you might be better of beginning before your first day at university with reviewing the school stuff). And do not expect university maths to be like school maths. At school you mainly learn some calculations. At university you need to learn formal reasoning and while you cannot do the job without the school basics it is in no way enough.


# English

English is not your mother's tongue? Neither mine. Get over it and read stuff that is origninally in English in English getting better in it and do not try to survive with the stuff for which there are translations. It will not suffice for academia.


# Communicate

Universities expect you to organize your stuff and while some provide some kind of mentoring in general this is the point in life where you are on your own. But you are not alone at sea or in the dessert. There are people around you. It is just about it being your responsible to get involved now. It is you who needs to make sure she gets organized her studying groups. It is you who is responsible for patching together your courses. It does not mean you cannot get help. Help is likely to be less controlling and more just collaborating or enabling but it is there. Communicate a lot. Do it as practising communicating your knowledge (and to uncover gaps) and do it even more if you actually need help. If you are overwhelmed as the faculty for counseling. There will be someone who will provide more strict help if you get in contact with them. But they will not be coming to you in general.


# General Guidlines

## Data management

You cannot afford to lose your work, none of it. You need to backup data once some kind of data difficult to reproduce has been created. That means measurements have to be backed up immidiately, everything you create regularly enough to be able to recover from the loss since last backup - at least once a week is usually a good guide line. You can usually lose a week but hardly a month (as that would be a whole semester in most cases). And once you have a backup make sure it actually works (you can restore the data) and keep it separated from your original data. If your notebook is stolen from your appartment that is a nuisance but if the backup external HD was beside it and was taken along with it you are ... well I am not in the US and may say fucked. So make it highly unlikely to lose both the stuff you use and the data backup together. For some of you cloud computing, faculty servers or similar resources might be a good approach.

Keep your stuff under version control. There are plenty of reasons to look back at earlier versions (and only the minority of them means you want them back, usually it is for some kind of chronological analysis). Git is currently the most obvious solution. It is much easier to use than most people think. Give it a try even if you work only on your own. Once you collaborate you'll find out that it is pretty much impossible without version controll anyways. Better to have some practise at that point.

Keep your stuff accessible. Some formats are likely accessible for any foreseeable period of time. Some are less likely to be readily accessible in a few years and some become inaccessible as soon as you change a tool, discontinue licensing something or such. Make sure you can rebuild your stuff. There are proven solutions around stuff such as LaTeX, Postscript and XML. Use them and not the last fancy mind map tool using a propriatary file format no one else understands.
