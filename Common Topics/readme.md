# Mathematics

No matter what your experience with mathematics is, you'll need to get a hang to it at university. Even if you are very far from the sciences you'll probably need some logic and some statistics. Some maths is hard (mostly because we do it not often enough) and some is realy hard (no matter how you approach it), but you are going for academical education and not dish washing so accept its hardships and take it on from the first day (actually you might be better of beginning before your first day at university with reviewing the school stuff). And do not expect university maths to be like school maths. At school you mainly learn some calculations. At university you need to learn formal reasoning and while you cannot do the job without the school basics it is in no way enough.


# English

English is not your mother's tongue? Neither mine. Get over it and read stuff that is origninally in English in English getting better in it and do not try to survive with the stuff for which there are translations. It will not suffice for academia.


# Communicate

Universities expect you to organize your stuff and while some provide some kind of mentoring in general this is the point in life where you are on your own. But you are not alone at sea or in the dessert. There are people around you. It is just about it being your responsible to get involved now. It is you who needs to make sure she gets organized her studying groups. It is you who is responsible for patching together your courses. It does not mean you cannot get help. Help is likely to be less controlling and more just collaborating or enabling but it is there. Communicate a lot. Do it as practising communicating your knowledge (and to uncover gaps) and do it even more if you actually need help. If you are overwhelmed as the faculty for counseling. There will be someone who will provide more strict help if you get in contact with them. But they will not be coming to you in general.
