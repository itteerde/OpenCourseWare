There is no real competition in what kind of technology you should use for scientific writing. LaTeX (originally TeX but more one the dependencies later) was developed to solve the inadequacies of scientific publishing at the time and while other tools could be considered as alternatives today there are very good reasons to stick with the domain master and very few to realy consider anything else. Lets face it: LaTeX is harder that Open Office Write or Microsoft Word, but it does what it is supposed to do once you have configured it in the right way and some of the most important scientific publications will not accept your entries in any other format anyways - so better get it started right now and learn it slowly all the way in parallel with your domain learning by using it for all kinds of excercises, term papers, thesis, ... If you are not too pretty you should not rely on some geek from the sciences to convert you thesis at the last moment once you realize that you cannot meet faculty standards with Word. (Not meaning to offend anyone but this realy was a recurring scheme when I was studying maths the first time. At the end of semester suddenly a lot of pretty economics students would turn up at the maths department and you'd have good odds they'd be looking for someone to convert their broken Word document to LaTeX (admittedly Word has come a long way since then and if your faculty has not to strict publishing standards and you are not working with lots of formulas you might get away with it nowadays for many of the arts [You habe better chances with Adobe InDesign or Scribus and still LaTeX is far supperior]).

So get a LaTeX system for your environment such as TeXLive and set it up to suit your needs. And while I admit that needs differ I argue that you should be able to do Unicode all the way therefore set up an editor that completely supports Unicode (and many still do not fully - this still kicks Texniccenter out of the picture). You might like to have the commands for the LaTeX system integrated into you editor up to the point that it is more appropriate to call it an integrated development environment (IDE), but that is not necessary (though I prefer it that way, too). Once you are set up to write .tex documents you should configure or script your environment to use XeLaTeX instead of PdfLaTeX as it supports Unicode all the way and Biber instead of BibTeX for the same reason.

Once you are able to create the hello world document as a PDF and able to include some kind of non-ASCII Unicode characters you are good to go.
