# Quote mining

I am not refering to the abuse of quotes out of context, but to the necessity to get references organized. There are at least three sources you'll get references from:

1. Library

Of course, you think? Yeah, I guess you knew you'd go to the library for getting the quotes you need. But what you might or might not have thought though is how to take and keep them. You could make copies of everything (and take notes of the book title, author name, publication date, ISBN, ... with it) but the paranthesis might have installed some initial doubt and I would argue for good reason. Working with printed books and papers I recommend to immidiately take the citation and put in LaTeX linked right away with its BibTeX reference. You might consider maintaining one document per course/ topic or such for that purpose and it might be a good idea to maintain a central BibTeX library of stuff you read and might use.


2. eBooks

This is probably the most convinient source for references. Simply keep a library of all eBooks you ever touched (hopefully the university stuff is DRM-free, if not print as PDF [with some possible difficulties to overcome]). You can go back to it every time you need the citation. While ergonomic reading probaly makes you chose paper for the reading it is always handy to have the book as an eBook for reference use (and fulltext search) ontop of it.


4. online resources

Web sites are vast providers of information and some of them absolutely are valid sources but you need to handle them appropriately. If you want to use some online reference you need to cite with the date of accessing it and in your interest as well as the interest of someone reading your work once that online source is gone you'd better also download the information and archive it or a PDF-printout (together with the appropriate citation information such as URL, date of download and usual stuff such as author (though that might turn out to be difficult)). The tendency to rely on online resources only if no classical literature is available still is common place and there are some good reasons such as archiving for it.
