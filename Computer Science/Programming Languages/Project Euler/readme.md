The goals are:

1. Learn how to solve (simple) problems in different programming systems
2. Learn how to write sufficiently efficient implementations in different programming systems
3. Compare performance of difference programming systems (nano-benchmarking)

There are implementations of the same problems for different languages within the individual languages.
