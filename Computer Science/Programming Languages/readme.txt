It is a recurring topic what languages you should learn. In my opinion that depends on at least two criteria:

1. What kind of engineer or scientist do you want to become?
2. In what area do you want to apply your expertise?

The first question determines to some extend how broad you should be looking at the different tools of the trade. The second very much gives you a base line that you cannot afford to miss. In most domains there are a few tools of the trade that you have to master. Adding to that is optional.

My advice would be roughly:


If you want to understand solving problems with computer programs you should know:

1. one low level language that lets you see what it is doing and maybe you at one point decide to realy use its proximity to the metal. A standard candidate would be C and since C++ directly allows you to use C while it supports most of the modern programming paradims as well as having good library and tool support I would call that C++ a fair candidate.

2. one object oriented language meaning some language at which oop comes natural and for which there are good oop ressources. C++ once again makes it to the list so you might consider to hit two targets with one language but if you do that be sure to understand what kind of C++ code is imperative, which is oop and which is even functional. You are welcome to mix paradims once you master them but you should be able to identify them first. Java is a very good candidate as it is one of the most usefull languages today with its vast library and tool support and it is purely oop - as far as it gets.

3. one functional language. I think to realy appreciate programming and look for the best tools for the job you need to know how different programming can be with (especially high level abstracting) functional programming. While Lisp/Scheme would be the classical example nowadays you might prefer to look for Haskell or Erlang - try Haskell if you realy have no idea what to go for.

4. one automation system. You want to be able to automate stuff beginning on your machine locally but soon you'll want to synchronize servers, automate builds and much more. While tools written in C++ or Java will do the job I think you should into a language created for these purposes. The little solution could be shell scripts. You'll get further with Go, Python, Perl or such languages, that can be used with an interpreter without the need to compile anyting and probably dynamically controlling what actually will be run, letting code generate code and so forth.


If you just need to be able to do some problem solving but are not interested in computer science and why it can help you - you just need the job to be done - you are likely to find your solutions with either Java (I would recommend that for any kind of person outside computer scienc who needs to do some programming) or inside a computational environment such as Mathematica, Mathlab or R.


And as mentioned you will also have to scan your environment for necessary tools of your trade and probably you'll need some basic understanding of standards such as HTML, XML, Unicode.
